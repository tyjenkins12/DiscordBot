Bot can be run locally with just the main.py and requirements.txt folder.
To work properly, you will need to also create a .env file with your unique DISCORD_TOKEN and OPENAI_API_KEY.

If running the bot on a docker server, utilize additional files.

If using portainer, the discord and openai tokens can be declared as environmental variables.
